# odin-recipies
The Recipes project from TOP

This project was to make a recipes website which would link to three different recipes. 
All of these recipes would have a certain format.

This project demonstrates my knowledge of basic HTML. In it, I use basic elements to create a simple site.
I use images, relative links, ordered and unordered lists, paragraphs, and different headers. This project
also demonstrates my knowledge of the use of Git. It shows that I know how to commit snapshots of my project, and that I know when and how to write the commit messages in a useful way. It shows that I can 
push my project onto GitHub.

This is just the beginning!
