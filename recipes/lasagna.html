    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>12 whole wheat lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground oregano, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>16 ounces of cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups tomato-basil pasta sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add lasagna noodles and cook for 10 minutes or until al dente; drain
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place ground beef, garlic, oregano, garlic powder, salt, 
            and black pepper in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until 
            beef is crumbly and evenly browned, about 10 minutes
        </li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and eggs together in a large bowl 
            until thoroughly combined.
        </li>
        <li>Lay 4 noodles side by side on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan; top
            with a layer of prepared tomato-basil sauce, a layer of ground beef mixture, and
            a layer of cottage cheese mixture. Repeat layers twice more,
            ending with a layer of sauce; sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top. 
            Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the lasagna is bubbling and the cheese has melted, 
            about 30 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>Remove foil and bake until cheese has begun to brown, 
            about 10 more minutes. Allow to stand at least 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
